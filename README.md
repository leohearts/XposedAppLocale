# Xposed App Locale
Set the language used by app.

This is a fork of the module made by @jiefoxi, which seems to be abandoned.

App Locale 2 fork seems also abandoned, so I made this fork to support Android 10.

## Compatibility

Tested on Android 10, RROS

Works:

- MyAndroidTools
- Voice Tools
- Edxposed Manager
- App Ops
- Elona
- Rusted Warfare
- ...etc ( rather limited )

Doesn't work:

- Google apps

- Github (but sometimes work...?)

- Firefox
- Smart Launcher 3
- Http canary
- ...etc

Trying to find out why.
